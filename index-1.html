                            <p>
                                Our client is a news site focussed on property, and also part of a well-known media
                                group. Since their revenue model is dependent on advertisements, the website is
                                constantly dependent on a steady flow of traffic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This meant having a steady production of content across the year. More content would
                                lead to more traffic to the website, and hence attracting more advertisers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the client already had a content team producing a steady volume of content,
                                traffic on the website was not growing. Our client knew content was the backbone of the
                                project and they were also aware that something was wrong in the entire flow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They wanted a partner who could explain to them what was wrong, show them how to do it
                                right. Also, they mostly had no idea of what was content marketing.

                                                        up to the mark. It was more volume and less quality. The
                                                        articles were too short, and were not covering the topic in
                                                        detail. In short, there was no value being offered in the
                                                        article. It was just content being written for the sake of
                                                        filling up the content publication schedule.

                                            <summary>This was an approach that simply would not work.</summary>

                                                <li>b. Secondly, there was no reasoning as to why a topic was being
                                                    picked, or why a topic should not be picked. Topics were basically
                                                    being selected randomly.

                                                <li> c. Thirdly, the content was not optimised. There were no keywords
                                                    that were being used, no meta titles or descriptions created, no
                                                    images used, no proper structure being defined.</li>

                                                    d. Also, the content design in the website was extremely bad. It was
                                                    just published as a bunch of text, all set together. There were no
                                                    breaks, no sub titles, no images, no spaces. Basically, once the
                                                    created was created and published, no one really cared of whether it
                                                    was being read. The UX was badly designed, without space for images
                                                    or linkage to other stories.

                                                e. Lastly, for organic traffic to flow in, you needed the content to
                                                rank. You needed to promote the content. That was not happening.
                                                There was no content strategy in place to rank the content and
                                                increase organic traffic.

                                                weeks, and what we’ve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental
                                                concepts. One, people are not wearing enough hats. Two, matter is
                                                energy. In the Universe there are many energy fields which we cannot
                                                normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon
                                                a person’s soul. However, this soul does not exist ab initio as orthodox
                                                Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process
                                                of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to
                                                man’s unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday
                                                trivia.</p>
