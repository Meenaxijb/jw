                                            Our client is a news site focussed on property, and also part of a
                                            well-known media
                                            group. Since their
                                            revenue model is dependent on advertisements, the website is constantly
                                            dependent on a
                                            steady flow of
                                            traffic.

                                            This meant having a steady production of content across the year. More
                                            content would lead to more
                                            traffic to the website, and hence attracting more advertisers.

                                            website was not growing. Our client knew content was the backbone of the
                                            project and they were
                                            also aware that something was wrong in the entire flow. </p>

                                    Also, they needed to boost their organic traffic within a very short span of time,
                                    which means they
                                    need
                                    an aggressive strategy through which results would start showing immediately.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Post analysis, we flagged off a few problems that had to be solved.</h3>
                                <p class="fst-italic">
                                    This was an approach that simply would not work.
                                </p>
                                <p>a. Firstly, the kind of content that was getting created was not up to the mark. It
                                    was more volume
                                    and
                                    less quality. The articles were too short, and were not covering the topic in
                                    detail. In short, there
                                    was
                                    no value being offered in the article. It was just content being written for the
                                    sake of filling up
                                    the
                                    content publication schedule. </p>
                                <p>
                                    b. Secondly, there was no reasoning as to why a topic was being picked, or why a
                                    topic should not be
                                    picked. Topics were basically being selected randomly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    c. Thirdly, the content was not optimised. There were no keywords that were being
                                    used, no meta titles
                                    or
                                    descriptions created, no images used, no proper structure being defined.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    d. Also, the content design in the website was extremely bad. It was just published
                                    as a bunch of
                                    text,
                                    all set together. There were no breaks, no sub titles, no images, no spaces.
                                    Basically, once the
                                    created
                                    was created and published, no one really cared of whether it was being read. The UX
                                    was badly
                                    designed,
                                    without space for images or linkage to other stories.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    e. Lastly, for organic traffic to flow in, you needed the content to rank. You
                                    needed to promote the
                                    content. That was not happening. There was no content strategy in place to rank the
                                    content and
                                    increase
                                    organic traffic.

                                <p>The Justwords team always starts with indepth research. This helped us analyse the
                                    competition and
                                    find the strategies they were using to draw in the traffic. The research also helped
                                    us discover loads
                                    of keywords that we could target with new content. It also showed us the gaps in
                                    content that was
                                    already produced, for eg, most articles that were published were not written from
                                    the SEO stand point,
                                    keyword research had been totally missing etc. </p>

                                <span>a. Firstly, we refurbished old content which was already ranking for certain
                                    keywords, but not at
                                    the top. We also found blogs which were not ranking for the right keywords. For eg,
                                    if you have a blog
                                    which has been written on how to buy farmhouses, and its ranking for farmhouse
                                    maintenance, then make
                                    sure you add content for the right keyword, and try to make it for the right
                                    keyword.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        b. We started finding keyword opportunities that would lead to high-volume
                                        traffic and create
                                        content that would help the user get all his questions answered. We started
                                        creating content in the
                                        long format, along with infographics, and started targeting all the keywords
                                        related to the topic.
                                        Keyword clusters were also identified and subtopics were also created to create
                                        a good linkage
                                        effect.

                                <p>The whole projected required a large volume of content to be created. The focus,
                                    however, was always
                                    on length and quality. The team always focussed on creating content that was indepth
                                    and covered as
                                    many question that could be found related to the topic. In short, the idea was to
                                    make it so
                                    exhaustive that you beat out the competition for the same topic.

                                    Every month, we created a list of topics that had a good potential to rank and get
                                    us traffic. We used
                                    our tried and tested Content Performance Formula to create the brief for the writing
                                    team to follow.
                                    The brief would cover the right mix of keywords that had to be used, the structure,
                                    and the content
                                    mapping. This is used consistently in all our content marketing campaigns and has
                                    led to successful
                                    results almost every time.

                                    We also worked with the client to get the overall look and feel of the news section
                                    revamped so that
                                    readability was improved. This would also reduce bounce rates.
